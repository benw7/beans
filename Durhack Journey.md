# Our Durhack Journey with Beans

## Very First Project

We tried to use Twillio and then a website API with input boxes to then send texts, however we decided this wasn't going to work well, so we then went onto the Plaintar project and we attempted to use real world data.

## First Project

We first decided that we wanted to make a project combining Twillio and using the Altreyx olmypic data set. We wanted to use a doping predictive model that when you inputted a country and event, it would give the user a probability of their chance of doping.
We were going to use python for machine learning, and then have a rotating globe on unity, with bars for different countries, and link these together.

Ben then made a superb program that predicted the likelihood of doping, which ran in O(1) of time.

## Blackrock Workshop

We then attended the coding workshop with MLH. We had the fish problem about selling for maximum profit. 
We then found that there was only 3 different bits of data possible, so instead of solving using for loops or recursion, Ben decided to use if, elif and else statements. So "Technically Ben" was added to the 3 people who completed it, and then amazingly "Technically Ben" won, taking a Blackrock swag bag away from someone who actually completed the challenge.

## Second Project 

We then decided the olympic data set was too large and not worthwhile, so we tried to look at ufc data with doping, we found some APIs to help and then we began to use this, however, we concluded that the strike data was worse when they doped meaning that there was no point of our algorithm at all, so we again gave up.

## Slideshow Karaoke

We then had some fun in slideshow karaoke with Josh presenting a lovely powerpoint about beans, and as we love beans this was a great time. And then Jacob followed later on with a presenting ANZAC, which was funny, but not about brie, cause you can't beat a good library / mcs sesh without brie, so Ben was sad.

## Third Project

We then decided that we wanted to make a game using C# and unity, we based it off of the tower game and used bean cans instead if the towers. However, as this was started at 4/5am it meant even though a decent amount of the project we couldn't entirely get it working, we made a good start and if we had more time it could have much better.

## Final words,

Thank you very much to everyone involved! It has been a great event, everyone has enjoyed their first hackathon.
